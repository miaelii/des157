                <p>There is no one “best posture” for all people because the physical architecture of individuals differs according to the bony structure they inherit. Good posture has many values for an individual. First, you are often judged by your appearance
                    – good posture commands attention. Secondly, it is an accepted psychological fact that good posture is associated with good morale – an individual with a good posture feels better and is more positive. An individual with poor posture
                    cannot feel as positive, and consequently develop a negative and discouraged attitude. Thirdly, good posture permits the body to function most efficiently. This is because the opposing muscle groups balance, thus maintaining the bony
                    structure in a balanced position. The correct bony alignment provides for the correct positions of the internal organs. The correct positions of the organs assist them in the performance of their various functions. Less strain and
                    tension is placed upon bones, muscles, ligaments and organs. Regardless of the amount of exercise and instruction you get; you habitually assume good posture only if you want to. </p><br>
