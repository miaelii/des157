                <h4><i>WHEN STANDING</i></h4>
                <p>Hold your head high, chin firmly forward, shoulders back, chest out, and stomach tucked in to increase your balance. If you stand all day in a job like a cashier or clerk, rest one foot on a stool or take breaks to get off your feet for
                    a while.</p>
                <h4><i>WHEN SITTING</i></h4>
                <p>Use a chair with firm low back support. Keep desk or table top elbow high, adjust the chair or use a footrest to keep pressure off the back of the legs, and keep your knees a little higher than your hips. Get up and stretch frequently--every
                    hour if you sit for long periods of time. Do not sit on a fat wallet; it can cause hip imbalance!</p>
                <h4><i>WHEN WORKING ON A COMPUTER</i></h4>
                <p>Take a one or two minute task break every 20 minutes when you work at a computer screen. Keep the screen 15 degrees below eye level. Place reference materials on a copy stand even with and close to the terminal.</p>
                <h4><i>WHEN SITTING IN THE CAR</i></h4>
                <p>Adjust the seat forward so your knees are higher than your hips. Put a small pillow or cushion in the small of your back.</p>
                <h4><i>WHEN SLEEPING</i></h4>
                <p>Sleep on your side with your knees bent and head supported by a pillow, to make your head level with your spine. Or, sleep on your back, avoiding thick pillows under your head. Use a small pillow under your neck instead. Don't sleep on
                    your stomach.</p><br>
