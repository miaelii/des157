            <article>
                <h4>The Wall Test:</h4>
                <p>Stand with the back of your head touching the wall and your heels six inches from the baseboard. With your buttocks touching the wall, check the distance with your hand between your lower back and the wall, and your neck and the wall.
                    If you can get within an inch or two at the low back and two inches at the neck, you are close to having excellent posture. If not, your posture may need professional attention to restore the normal curves of your spine.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>The Mirror Test:</h4>
                <p><i>(Front view) Stand facing a full length mirror and check to see if:</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your shoulders are level</li>
                    <li>Your head is straight</li>
                    <li>The spaces between your arms and sides seem equal</li>
                    <li>Your hips are level, your kneecaps face straight ahead</li>
                    <li>Your ankles are straight</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>(Side View) This is much easier to do with the help of another, or by taking a photo.
Check for the following:</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Head is erect, not slumping forward or backwards</li>
                    <li>Chin is parallel to the floor, not tilting up or down</li>
                    <li>Shoulders are in line with ears, not drooping forward or pulled back</li>
                    <li>Stomach is flat</li>
                    <li>Knees are straight</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lower back has a slightly forward curve (not too flat or not curved too much forward, creating a hollow back).
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>The 'Jump' Test:</h4>
                <p>Feel the muscles of your neck and shoulders. Do you find areas that are tender and sensitive? Are the buttock muscles sore when you apply pressure? What about the chest muscles?</p>
                <br>
                <h4>When Lifting:</h4>
                <p>Let your legs do the work in order to prevent injury to your low back. Stand close to the object, then where possible squat down and straddle it. Grasp the object, and slowly lift the load by straightening your legs as you stand up. Carry
                    the object close to your body.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>When Bending:</h4>
                <p>Never twist from the waist and bend forward at the same time. To lift or reach something on the floor, bend the knees while keeping the back straight.</p><br></article>
