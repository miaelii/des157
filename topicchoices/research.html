    <a href="../index.html">back</a>
    <p>The three websites that I chose to use as research for my fitness app are three articles that advise good weekly workout plans. My goal of my fitness app is to bridge the gap between the fitness industry and everybody else. I want to promote a healthy
        fitness induced lifestyle for people of all kinds. This app will primarily be an app that provides fresh and fun 15-20 minute at home workouts for people to do. In order to achieve this, I must create very specific workout plans that people can
        do and modify to their own bodies. <br>The first website I decided to use is an article from gymjunkies.com they created a beginner’s workout for different weeks, increasing the reps. This workout plan is a good template for me not to replicate,
        but have a good sense of what a beginner’s workout plan should look like. <br>The second website I used is a 4 Essential Tips to Build the Perfect Workout Program by Muscle and Fitness. Muscle and Fitness has great content and information for
        people in the fitness industry of all levels of expertise. These tips will help me get a good sense of my range the amount of sets and reps I should throw in for my users, and how often I should change the numbers up. I will generate a random
        weekly number selection so a random day a week, the “off-day” will contain a simpler workout. <br>The final article I used is also from Muscle and Fitness and it’s a Beginners Training Guide. This article stresses the form of a workout over the
        reps. I’m going to incorporate easy to modify workouts for the first few weeks so my users will develop good form and build up their strength. <br>These sites are so aesthetically unappealing, and makes the user go through so much research for
        a good workout plan. With my pre-planning, I’ll take the work off the users shoulders with my extensive research I’ll be doing beforehand.
