    <p>I found the audience testing super fun and helpful! This is a picture of my favorite tester using my app! She had a super positive experience with the app and really wants to get it on her phone when I'm finished with it! In this photo, she's using
        the login feature that I spent most of my time before the audience testing trying to figure out. The feedback was really resourceful and I asked my testers to tell me what they wished they'd see. There were certain features that I really agree
        with an will probably add to the app when I have my independent study. the most outstanding thing I know I need to change is where the users go after they sign out. Instead of going to the login page again, I should bring them to the Fit Fifteen
        get started page.</p>
