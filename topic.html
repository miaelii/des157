    <p>Topic Choice:<br>Interdisciplinary platforms for coexistence. I want to create a fitness app for social change to bridge the gap between the fitness industry and everybody else. I want to promote a healthy fitness induced lifestyle for people of all
        kinds. This app will primarily be an app that provides fresh and fun 15-20 minute at home workouts for people to do. This reaches out to the non-gym goers and busy students and people with time-consuming jobs. Each workout will be different (I'll
        generate a special formula to calculate the workouts) so that weekly, a user who uses the app daily would have worked every muscle group. This takes the thinking away from the user, making it easy to use. Special funtions about this app: it will
        be able to save the date and workout the user has completed, a calendar view of the days they've completed a routine, and a catalog of workout names and how to do them.</p>
    <p>Parnerships: <br> I don't have a partner at the moment, but I'm open to having one if anyone wants to work on my idea with me</p>
