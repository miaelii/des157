    <p>This image is a screenshot of the Kayla Itsines app. It's a workout app with meal plans and a community section that allows people to post progress photos. This community section helps people get motivated and encourage one another to keep pushing
        forth. This app is a paid app, so users need to pay a fee to access the workouts. For my app, I want it to be free because I want people of all sorts to have access to fitness. For people who don't have gym memberships because they're afraid of
        the gym, don't have a ride, or can't afford it, for people who don't have time to do solid workouts, I want my app to be similar in style to the Kayla Itsines app because I want a section that describes how to do the workout, and a section for
        the actual workout, preferably with a timer that can play over the music a person is listening to on their phone already. I want this to be an easy, no-brainer app that will eventually train a user's whole body through targeted muscle groups and
        cardio warm ups for a healthy heart. This app is similar to the app I have in mind because there are workouts picked for the user already and sets and reps written down to track the progress.</p>

    <p>This image is a screenshot of the Lauren Elizabeth app. It's a lifestyle app that pertains to health, fashion, make-up, etc. I really like the aesthetic of this app and think that the clean look would be something that my target audience which is
        mainly females would really enjoy using. I want my app to be really easily accessible for my users and simple to navigate. I want my app to be easy on the eyes so that they look forward to opening the app, and are more willing to share screenshots
        of their workouts and progress to their friends.</p>
