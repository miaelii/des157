        <img src="studio3ss.png" alt="studio3image" width="500">
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Talk about why your studio 3 works and what makes it interesting and effective.<br><br> I created my studio 3 to be based around photography because that's a major hobby of mine, and in a way, my photos are something I
            collect because I love printing them out and hanging them around my workspace and bedroom. They're very personal because they put me back in the place I was when I was traveling to the place the photograph was. I'm a versy visual person, and
            the borders I put around the photos to give it a window-feel provides the illusion that someone is peering into a personal part of my life. I also thing that the content is effective and relevant because I put my camera settings on it, giving
            users who soley like the photos a sense of how I used my camera. I also think the use of the background mountain photo provides a really aesthetic and inviting platform for users seeing this for the time. It makes for a very obvious photography
            page.

    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Critique a web-based form that you use often. <br><br> This website is not so much a 'form', but I think that it uses the form functions to create user posts. I use Tumblr a lot. I've kept a personal blog since the 7th grade
        and I think the reason why I contantly resort to this website is because of it's usability and customization that is really centered around the user. There are comments available for users to interact with one another and give each other feedback.
        All the marks on this website are clear for the users.</p>

        <img src="google.jpg" alt="google" width="500">
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Evaluate a user interface that you use often in terms of the visual design, appeal and effectiveness. This is an opportunity to comm-unicate your ideas and pespectives on effective interface design. <br><br> A user interface
            that I often use often is the Google search engine. The visual design is aesthetically pleasing for it’s purpose. It’s very clean and easy to read, and the Google banner changes everyday, informing the users of special holidays and birthdays
            that should be honored. The Google search engine is also very quick to load and gives the users previews of the context in the page. The website is also very compatible with cellphones, making it really easy to navigate on the mobile view.
            There are tabs for easy access to shopping, images, videos, etc. What I’ve really liked about the Google search engine is when I try to search a celebrities age, a box will pop up with all the information a user would potentially want to know
            about the celebrity like his/her age, height, birthday, relatives, appearances. I think that Google’s user-interface is very user-friendly and easy on the eyes. The spacing of all the words and search results help make it the most popular
            search engine.</p>
